***WIDE*** (**W**itcherScript **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) is unofficial Witcher 3 modding tooling aimed at improving developer experience by supplying them with powerful code analysis tools in the form of an editor extension making use of a Language Server.

The goal is to have a full set of features that will make [ScriptStudio](https://witcher-games.fandom.com/wiki/Script_Studio) obsolete and reduce the overhead of fixing compilation errors detected when launching the game.

Currently the only supported client is Visual Studio Code.
