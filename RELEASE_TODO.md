# Release TODOs

Just a list of all the tasks that are to be done during the release period, so I don't forget about any of them :sweat_smile:

1. Bump version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Bump version in client `package.json`
3. Update extension README
4. Update extension CHANGELOG
5. Update documentation
6. Verify the website
7. Verify documentation/site links
8. Upload release to VSCode Marketplace
9. Move tasks on the board to `Shipped`
