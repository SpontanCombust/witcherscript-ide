# Native content scripts

Here, all the symbols that can be accessed in WitcherScript without `import`ing them are collected and if possible declared.
Stuff that cannot be declared in the WitcherScript language must be manually programmed into IDE.
Most of the types can be found by looking through 1.21 commented scripts.
