# Frequently Asked Questions

> Creating/renaming scripts in the editor doesn't get detected.

When in doubt explicitly save the file using `Ctrl + S`. This should refresh source trees. This is especially true in case of changes to folders.

> Does WIDE support symbolic links (symlinks)?

WIDE at the moment does not offer support for directories and files stored as symbolic links.

> I'm getting syntax errors for annotations added in the recent game patch.

The aformentioned patch has been released just days before the planned v0.3.0 release of WIDE. Adding support for them could not be done within that timeframe. If you want to test these new modding features while also enjoying WIDE, I advice turning off syntax analysis in the configuration until a patch to WIDE is released that adds support for annotations.  <!-- TODO remove when ready -->
