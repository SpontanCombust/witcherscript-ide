# Getting started

Install the extension from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpontanCombust.witcherscript-ide) or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/SpontanCombust/witcherscript-ide) if you're using other VSCode variants. You can also grab a .vsix file directly from the [releases](https://github.com/SpontanCombust/witcherscript-ide/releases) page.

WIDE's VSCode extension comes with a quick walkthrough that will guide you through necessary steps to make it work. If you can't find the walkthrough use the command `"Welcome: Open Walkthrough..."` in the command palette and search for WitcherScript IDE.
