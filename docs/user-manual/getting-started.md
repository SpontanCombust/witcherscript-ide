# Getting started

1. Install the extension from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpontanCombust.witcherscript-ide) or grab a .vsix file for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/SpontanCombust/witcherscript-ide/releases) page.
2. Configure paths to existing vanilla and mod scripts by going to settings (File > Preferences > Settings). Start typeing "witcherscript" and look for "Game Directory" and "Content Repositories" settings.
3. Open the command prompt using Ctrl + Shift + P and start typeing "witcherscript". Choose a command to create or initialize a WitcherScript project.

Alternatively if you're already working on a mod using the REDKit you can open the editor in your project's folder. This still requires step 2 to work properly.
