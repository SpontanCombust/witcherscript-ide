# Getting started

1. Install the extension from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpontanCombust.witcherscript-ide) or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/SpontanCombust/witcherscript-ide) if you're using other VSCode variants. You can also grab a .vsix file directly from the [releases](https://github.com/SpontanCombust/witcherscript-ide/releases) page.
2. Configure paths to existing vanilla and mod scripts by going to settings (File > Preferences > Settings). Start typeing "witcherscript" and look for "Game Directory" and "Content Repositories" settings.
3. Open the command prompt using Ctrl + Shift + P and start typeing "witcherscript". Choose a command to create or initialize a WitcherScript project.

You can skip step 3. if you're already working on a mod using the REDKit modding tool. Just open the editor in your project's directory. If you want to use other mods as a dependency for your mod for example you should still check out [`witcherscript.toml` projects](./project-system.md#project) though.
